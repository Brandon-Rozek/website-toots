Let’s illustrate our point with a couple examples and discuss various ways we can make it more readable.\nDisjunction Elimination Disjunction Elimination or proof by cases is a rule of inference that states the following. Consider you have the following three proofs:\n$p \\vee q$ $p \\rightarrow r$ $q \\rightarrow r$ Then it doesn’t matter if it is $p$ rather than $q$ that holds, in the end $r$ holds.","embed_url":"","height":0,"html":"","image":null,"image_description":"","language":"en","provider_name":"","provider_url":"","published_at":null,"title":"Readable Lean 3 Proofs","type":"link","url":"https://brandonrozek.com/blog/readable-lean3-proofs/","width":0},"content":"<p>How do you organize your Lean proofs?
