I have not seen that episode of Star Trek. Though funny enough, I did watch, based on a recommendation from another,  an episode within the original series called &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;. It&#39;s always fun to see these concepts covered in media, I&#39;ll have to check out the episode you mentioned :)</p>","date":"2022-04-30T21:09:20.407Z","edited_at":null,"emojis":[],"favourites_count":1,"id":"108223067612891268","in_reply_to_account_id":"312622","in_reply_to_id":"108223017415670570","language":"en","media_attachments":[],"mentions":[{"acct":"proactiveservices","id":"312622","url":"https://fosstodon.org/@proactiveservices","username":"proactiveservices"}],"poll":null,"reblog":null,"reblogs_count":0,"replies_count":2,"sensitive":false,"spoiler_text":"","syndication":"https://fosstodon.org/@brozek/108223067612891268","tags":[],"visibility":"public"}
